Flying Circus Workshop
---
This is a python intro workshop I presented to our QA team to help with Automation

If your team is as awesome as mine following these steps will have them committing code within two weeks :) 

1. Breaks for Monty Python sketches
2. A lot of puns
3. Honest passion for the language is contagious
Bonus: try singing the Lumberjack song

What if they've never seen Monty Python?
